# SpotFakePlus
This repository contains codes for the paper titled: SpotFake+: A Multimodal Framework for Fake News Detection via Transfer Learning.

It leverages transfer learning to capture semantic and contextual information from the news articles and its associated images and achieves the better accuracy for
fake news detection. '

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that performs a multimodal approach for fake news detection on a dataset that consists of full length articles. It
outperforms the performance shown by both single modality and multiple-modality models.
